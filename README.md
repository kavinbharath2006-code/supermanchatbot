This is a killer setup!
You’ve combined a dark, cinematic aesthetic with a functional local LLM implementation. 
To match the "DarkVerse" vibe, the README should feel as atmospheric as the app itself while remaining technically professional.Here is the custom README.md content for your project:
🩸 DarkVerse AI 
🦇DarkVerse AI is a cinematic, localized LLM chat interface designed for a dark comic universe experience. Built with Streamlit and powered by Ollama, it transforms standard AI interactions into a mythic, poetic, and visually immersive descent into the abyss.✨
FeaturesCinematic UI: Custom CSS injected with radial gradients, glowing red orbs, and drifting heroic symbols.
Dynamic Personalities: A locked-in System Prompt ensures the AI maintains a dramatic, dark poetic tone.
Chaos Control: Real-time temperature manipulation to adjust the unpredictability of the "Mind."Local & Private: Runs entirely on your machine using Ollama—no data ever leaves the abyss.
Animated Feedback: Smooth fade-in transitions and custom-themed chat bubbles.🛠 Tech StackComponentTechnologyFrontendStreamlit (Python)LLM EngineOllamaStylingCustom CSS / HTML InjectionLanguagePython 3.10+🚀 Getting Started1.
